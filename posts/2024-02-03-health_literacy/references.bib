  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to compare performance of logistic regression (LR) with machine learning (ML) for clinical prediction modeling in  the literature. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a Medline literature  search (1/2016 to 8/2017) and extracted comparisons between LR and ML models for  binary outcomes. RESULTS: We included 71 of 927 studies. The median sample size  was 1,250 (range 72-3,994,872), with 19 predictors considered (range 5-563) and  eight events per predictor (range 0.3-6,697). The most common ML methods were  classification trees, random forests, artificial neural networks, and support  vector machines. In 48 (68\%) studies, we observed potential bias in the  validation procedures. Sixty-four (90\%) studies used the area under the receiver  operating characteristic curve (AUC) to assess discrimination. Calibration was  not addressed in 56 (79\%) studies. We identified 282 comparisons between an LR  and ML model (AUC range, 0.52-0.99). For 145 comparisons at low risk of bias, the  difference in logit(AUC) between LR and ML was 0.00 (95\% confidence interval,  -0.18 to 0.18). For 137 comparisons at high risk of bias, logit(AUC) was 0.34  (0.20-0.47) higher for ML. CONCLUSION: We found no evidence of superior  performance of ML over LR. Improvements in methodology and reporting are needed  for studies that compare modeling algorithms.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health of adolescents are emerging and require particular attention in settings where challenges like armed conflict, poverty and internal displacement have previously affected their mental wellbeing. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of anxiety symptoms, depressive symptomatology, probable post-traumatic stress disorder and resilience in school-attending adolescents in a post-conflict area of Tolima, Colombia during the COVID-19. A cross-sectional study was carried out with 657 adolescents from 12 to 18 years old, recruited by convenience sampling in 8 public schools in the south of Tolima, Colombia, who completed a self-administered questionnaire. Mental health information was obtained through screening scales for anxiety symptoms (GAD-7), depressive symptomatology (PHQ-8), probable post-traumatic stress disorder (PCL-5) and resilience (CD-RISC-25). The prevalence observed for moderate to severe anxiety symptoms was 18.9\% (95\% CI 16.0–22.1) and for moderate to severe depressive symptomatology was 30.0\% (95\% CI 26.5–33.7). A prevalence of probable post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) of 22.3\% (95\% CI 18.1–27.2) was found. The CD-RISC-25 results for resilience had a median score of 54 [IQR 30]. These results suggest that approximately two-thirds of school-attending adolescents in this post-conflict area experienced at least one mental health problem such as anxiety symptoms, depressive symptomatology or probable PTSD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies are of interest to establish the causal relationship between these findings and the impact of the pandemic. These findings highlight the challenge that schools have after pandemic to address the mental health of their students in order to promoting adequate coping strategies and implement prompt multidisciplinary interventions to reduce the burden of mental health problems in adolescents.},
